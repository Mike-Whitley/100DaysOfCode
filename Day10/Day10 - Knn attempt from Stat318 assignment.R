#fit kNN regression models to the Autodata set to predict Y=mpg using X=horsepower.
#This data has been divided into training and testing sets:AutoTrain.csv and AutoTest.csv(download these sets from Learn).
#ThekNN() R function on Learn should be used to answer this question (you need torun the kNNcode before calling the function).
#(a)  Perform  kNN  regression  with k=  2,5,10,20,30,50  and  100,  (learning  from  thetraining data)
#and compute the training and testing MSE for each value ofk.
#(b)  Which value of k performed best? Explain.
#(c)  Plot the training data, testing data and the best kNN model in the same figure.
#(The points() function is useful to plot the kNN model because it is discontinuous.)
#(d)  Describe the bias-variance trade-off for kNN regression.
